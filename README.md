**3Bees** is a web application that lets you discover and filter the latest free game giveaways 🎮.  
Built with **JavaScript (ES6 modules)**, **Axios**, and dynamic DOM rendering, it connects to the [GamerPower API](https://www.gamerpower.com/).  

## Why 🐝 **3Bees**?
- *Because I love giveaways! Nearly 98% of my game library comes from free giveaways — so I built 3Bees to help others discover and claim them easily.*
- *I also enjoyed the wordplay — *3Bees* sounds just like **Freebies** 🐝🎮*
